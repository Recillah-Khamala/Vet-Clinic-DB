# Vet-Clinic-DB
In this project, I use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. I start with one table, and step by step, create a complete database with data about:  animals, animals' owners, clinic employees, and visits. Apart from building data structure, I also run SQL queries to answer specific questions.
